abstract: The positivity assumption is a fundamental requirement for causal inference in
the potential outcomes framework, ensuring that all individuals have a positive prob-
ability of receiving each treatment option. However, real-world datasets often violate
this assumption, particularly in regions of non-overlap where one treatment group
is underrepresented or entirely absent for certain combinations of confounding vari-
ables. Traditional approaches, such as trimming and weighting, address these viola-
tions but typically modify the target population, potentially introducing bias. The
Bayesian Additive Regression Trees with Spline Models (BART+SPL) approach has
been proposed as a solution to this issue. BART+SPL combines Bayesian Addi-
tive Regression Trees (BART) for imputation in regions of treatment overlap with
spline models (SPL) for extrapolation into non-overlap regions, preserving the ini-
tial target population. However, BART+SPLâ€™s performance is compromised when
dealing with high-dimensional covariates. To address this limitation, this paper pro-
poses SBART+SPL, an extension of the BART+SPL framework that integrates Soft-
BART into the estimation procedure. SoftBART generalizes BART by implement-
ing smooth decision rules and sparsity-inducing splitting probabilities. A simulation
study demonstrates that SBART+SPL yields better precision and improved cover-
age compared to BART+SPL when estimating population average treatment effects
(PATE) in the presence of high-dimensional covariates and violations of the posi-
tivity assumption. Additionally, the applicability of SBART+SPL is illustrated by
re-analyzing an empirical study that evaluates the impact of exposure to natural gas
compressor stations on cancer mortality rates across U.S. counties.
