abstract: We introduce a novel approach that combines Bayesian Causal Forests (BCF) with
Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) to assess effect heterogeneity of a binary treatment
under unit-varying costs. Recently, CEA Forests have been proposed to estimate
heterogeneous effects in a frequentist setting using Generalized Random Forests (GRF).
This approach requires, first, estimating the uplift of the cost and the outcome
effect, and, second, differencing the unit-level effects. We translate CEA Forests
into a Bayesian framework, which holds promise for improving accuracy, facilitating
seamless uncertainty quantification, and more effectively capturing sparsity within
the underlying data generating process. A simulation study illustrates guidelines for
visual and metric-based CEA based on our approach. In comparison to the GRF-based
method, we find that our method outperforms the GRF, especially under smoothness
in the covariate signal and in small samples.
