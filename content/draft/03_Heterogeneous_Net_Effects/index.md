abstract: "We develop a method for estimating heterogeneous net treatment effects under unit-varying outcome and cost effects. Within the generalized random forest framework, we propose to minimize a joint R-loss criterion besides naive direct or two-step modeling approaches to account for differences in the complexity of the response surfaces. The final model combines the three estimation strategies using the SuperLearner approach. Additionally, we discuss an empirical application. We use data from a large nonprofit organization to analyze the net effect of a fundraising campaign for targeted policy-making to increase pledge payments while avoiding donor attrition."
